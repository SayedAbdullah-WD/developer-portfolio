            <p>“Traveling is a brutality. It forces you to trust strangers and to lose sight of all that familiar
                comfort of
                home and friends. You are constantly off balance. Nothing is yours except the essential things — air,
                sleep,
                dreams, the sea, the sky — all things tending towards the eternal or what we imagine of it.” – Cesare
                Pavese
